## Hi, I'm Anusha 👋

I'm a data scientist and NLP researcher passionate about using language to explore questions around bias, fairness, and digital identity.

### A few fun facts:
- 🎓 Graduated from UMass Amherst (DACSS)
- 💬 Fluent in English, Tamil, and dry sarcasm
- 🧪 Working on uncovering gender bias in large language models
- 🏔 I hike to think, I lift to cope, and I write to connect
