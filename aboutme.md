title: About me

---

Hello there, I’m Nush! I’m a data scientist and biomedical engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that bridge technology and human experience. My work spans from deploying software solutions in live neurosurgery to exploring machine learning, natural language processing, large language models, generative AI, and agentic AI, always with the goal of making complex systems more intuitive and impactful.

Growing up across Germany, Singapore, and the U.S. gave me a global perspective and a curiosity about how culture, creativity, and data intersect. I express myself through photography, fashion, painting, writing, poetry, storytelling, singing, and guitar. Each of these passions teaches me something about observation, pattern, and expression, and they shape the way I approach AI and problem-solving. This space is where creativity and analysis come together to inspire new ideas and meaningful work.
