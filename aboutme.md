title: About me

---

Hello there, I'm Nush! I’m a data scientist and biomedical engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that bridge technology and human experience. My work spans from deploying software solutions in live neurosurgery to exploring machine learning, generative, and agentic AI, always with the goal of making complex systems more intuitive and impactful.

Growing up across Germany, Singapore, and the U.S. shaped my global outlook and curiosity about how data, culture, and creativity intersect. Beyond the code, I’m an artist who finds inspiration in color, structure, and storytelling, the same elements that drive my work in AI. This space is where both worlds meet.
