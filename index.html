Hi! My name is Anusha Sivakumar and I am a Data Scientist who is also a Biomedical Engineer. I used to work in Neurosurgery as a Clinical Software Consultant for optimal implementation of navigation software powered by AI/ML for 100% success in patient outcome :) Working with tons of patient health data in research projects got me inspired to pursue data-driven pursuits and here I am now working on fairness and biases in LLMs which ultimately power Agentic AI systems.
